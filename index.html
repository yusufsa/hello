        <p>I think about and tinker with ways to empower more people as creatives.</p>  
        <p>I'm a <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/yusufa/overview/" target="_blank">grad student</a> at the MIT Media Lab.
          I am currently developing a creative design tool for educators, exploring future models for learning, and experimenting with ways to bring open-ended, project-based learning online in response to COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Before MIT, I helped launch a <a href="https://www.alueducation.com/" target="_blank">pan-African University network</a> with sites in Mauritius, Rwanda, South Africa, and Kenya. 
          We remixed ideas from Minerva, Ashesi, High Tech High, 42, and many others as we tried to create a new kind of university: 
          hands on projects, research, and internships replaced lectures and problem sets. 
          We've only graduated two classes, but our graduates are already making waves accross the continent. 
          They've started businesses that employ hundreds, championed human rights, gone on to pursue groundbreaking graduate research at places like Oxford and Harvard, 
          and are just getting started.
